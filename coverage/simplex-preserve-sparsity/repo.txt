cc92fe0 Merge branch 'master' into simplex-preserve-sparsity
03d3202 SimplexTest: enable test which now passes. Fix other tests which were asserting the previous incorrect behaviour
ed14f79 SimplexTest: ineqType3: drop extra variable
5785dbc getRoundedSampleValue: fix bug with rounding
ddbbaf4 SimplexTest: ineqType3: simplify case and fix the comments
3b61ada toCol: assert for errors instead of returning a status code
b2d457b rowIsObviouslyNotZero: fix documentation
77986f4 Merge branch 'master' of spclgitlab.ethz.ch:mt-maxf/libint
517a1d8 detectImplicitEqualities: iterate through constraints in reverse order for isl parity
f747ea8 detectImplicitEqualities: slight refactor
cb1ca5d Revert "Simplex: detectImplicitEqualities: don't use the marked stuff, just look in reverse order through the constraints. This fixes the issue where the iteration order was different from that in isl."
8183e72 Revert "Simplex: Remove unknownIsRelevant since it is not used anymore"
d852892 detectRedundant: restore the the detectRedundant marked stuff since it actually affects pivots (and performance)
43f01ce closeRow: fix issue where the row wouldn't be marked zero if it was a temporary variable
7e2867c closeRow: make default argument explicit
8b0cd47 constraintIsRedundant: assert that the constraint wasn't already marked redundant
f8d939d closeRow: don't check if the tab became empty if it was already empty before
a6bbb00 signOfMax: add an assert
67d51e4 Simplex: cutToHyperplane: remove redundant assert. Add an assert that is present in isl
2b85aae Simplex: ineqType: check if the constraint was already marked redundant by the previous call to signOfMax
907f002 Transprecision: Fix sparsity/zerocheck benchmarks
